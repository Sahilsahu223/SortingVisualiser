# Sorting Visualizer Tutorial  

This project is a tutorial based on Clement Mihailescu's [Sorting Visualizer project](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Sorting-Visualizer).  

## Project Structure  

All tutorial-related code is located in the following directories:  
- `/src/SortingVisualizer` â€“ Main component for visualizing sorting algorithms.  
- `/src/sortingAlgorithms` â€“ Implementations of various sorting algorithms.  

The `SortingVisualizer` component is imported and rendered in `App.js`.  

## Getting Started  

### Installation  

1. Clone the repository:

   ```  
2. Install dependencies:
